Welcome! Our models initially come with customized Built-In (SRP) shaders. Depending on the package you choose, we have also created custom shaders (water, glass, etc.) in both SRP and URP variants.

1. Package "SRP_to_URP.unitypackage".
For your convenience, we have created a .unitypackage called "SRP_to_URP". This package automatically changes the shaders of all materials from SRP to URP. To install this package:
- Open your project in Unity.
- Go to the Assets menu and open the "URP_Extract_Me" folder.
- Double click on the "SRP_to_URP" file.
- Click the "Import" button.
After .unitypackage makes the changes to the materials it will change the Built-In shader to URP.

2. Installing the Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
If you prefer to switch from SRP to URP yourself, you can install "Universal RP" through the Package Manager window. Follow these steps:
- Open your project in Unity.
- Go to Window > Package Manager.
- In the list of available packages, find and install "Universal RP".

3- Using the Render Pipeline Converter
After installing URP, you can use the "Render Pipeline Converter" utility to convert all Built-In (SRP) shaders to URP. To use this utility:
- Go to Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline Converter.
- Select the "Built-In to URP" option
- Check "Rendering Setting", "Material Upgrade" and other items if necessary.
- After that, click "Initialize Converters", wait for the operation to complete and click "Convert Assets".
After this procedure the tool will enable URP in your project and change the shaders on all materials from Built-In to URP.

4. Using Custom Shaders
If you use custom shaders in your project, you must use the version of the shader that corresponds to the rendering version you are using. That is:
- If the project uses Built-In (SRP), the shaders must be from the SRP_Shaders folder.
- If the project uses URP, the shaders must be from the URP_Shaders folder.
You can assign a shader to a material by dragging the shader onto the material itself.

Conclusion
We hope that this documentation will help you to easily customize our project to your needs. If you have any questions or problems, feel free to contact our support team on Discord.
